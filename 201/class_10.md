# Debugging

Debugging is a vital process for programmers. This has helped me diagnose problems in my code and using proper tools limits trial and error.

## Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error

A syntax error can be thought of as something that is 'grammatically' incorrect. Such as a spelling error `funtcion doSometing()` note the errors.

A logical error can be explained as an error that is not related to syntax but rather programmer logic. The code will be correct in all but logic. A good example of this is an off by one error.

The key difference between the two errors is JS can still run some code that contains syntax errors, but not always. A logic error will run it will just be less noticeable and harder to debug as the code is written syntactically correct.

## List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them

I often made error while doing the loop function, normally off or over 1 unit. I used the console.log to track this to make sure I have the correct one overtime.

I have written CSS that targetted the wrong ID, or the wrong CLASS, cause I tend to mistake one to another. I used the suggestion in VS code to make sure I choose the correct syntax.

## How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals

Well bugs are a big part of coding and as such they will influence my goal to be a programmer. I think bugs are just part of the workflow and creative process. Sometimes we don't always think about things in the same way and that's where we as coders bring value in the world of AI. I will continue to embrace the pain.

## How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JS Debugger will allow you to watch your code being executed. This allows you to see issues during runtime, such as messed up variables, type mismatch, and many other errors.

## Define what a breakpoint is

A breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes. It is also sometimes simply referred to as a pause.

## What is the call stack

A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.
