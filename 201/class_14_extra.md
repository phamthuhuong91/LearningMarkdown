## Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
I worked mostly in a academia scientfic laboratory. So I consider myself working in a psychologicaly safe enviromnet. All my supervisor and team member are very supportive. Each of us work on individual project, so there was not a lot of conflicts. But when we need to work on the same one, we discussed each step with each other every week. The team members sometimes neeed more guidence but I think it is expected. By the way, I never managed people, only attitudes.

## What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
Based on my experience, this would help with the goals of the projects and the mental health of all the members. I do not fear to vocie my opinion even though it can seem to be incorrect.
