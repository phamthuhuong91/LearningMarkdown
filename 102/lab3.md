### What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

1. ***Code completion***. This feature will display the most possible command based on what you have typed. This will save you time.
2. ***Syntax highlighting***. This will make the text easier to read.
3. ***Themes***.
4. ***Possible Extensions***.


### What do the following commands do?

ls - list the contents of a directory

cd - change directory - a.k.a move to another directory

mkdir - make a new directory - a.k.a make a new folder

touch - use to create a new empty file

cd projects - change directory to folder named projects

mkdir new-project - make a new folder named new-project

touch new-project/newfile.md - make a new md file named newfile

cd .. - go to the parent folder

ls projects/new-project - list the contents in new-project folder
