# What is the purpose of CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which allows one to create great-looking web pages. In short, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to user. 

# What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?

- External stylesheet: use a seperate file with a .css extension to store the document's style and layout. The HTML &lt;a&gt;; element is used for reference an external CSS stylesheet. This practice is used for site with multiple pages.

- Internal stylesheet: it resides within an HTML document, using a &lt;style&gt; element contained inside the HTML &lt;head&gt;.

- Inline styles: they are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a style attribute.

# Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text.

&lt;p style="color:red;"&gt;This text is red&lt;/p&gt;
