  <h2>What is a growth mindste</h2>
A growth mindset is a belief that one can learn something new (skills, knowledge, etc) with persistent, right stratergies and practice.
  <h2>Ways that I use to develop a growth mindset</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><b><i>Learn something new</i></b> It can be a new language, an instrument, hisotry or economics. I tried to learn couples different languages beside my native one, which is Vietnamese, and secondary one, which is English. The list is French, Spanish, Japanese, Korean and Chinese. Of course, I cannot learn all these languages but at least I am at intermediate level in Chinese now.</li>
  <li><b><i>Set a realistic goal</i></b> Normally I often make a weekly, monthly and yearly goal. A smaller step is always easier to achieve.</li>
  <li><b><i>Mistakes are fine</i></b> This is a part of the learning process. As long as, I learn something along the way.</li>
  </ul>
