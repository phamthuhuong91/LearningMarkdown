## What is a growth mindset?
A growth mindset is a belief that one can learn something new (skills, knowledge, etc) with persistent, right stratergies and practice. 

## Ways that I use to develop a growth mindset
(1) Learn something new. It can be a new language, an instrument, hisotry or economics. I tried to learn couples different languages beside my native one, which is Vietnamese, and secondary one, which is English. The list is French, Spanish, Japanese, Korean and Chinese. Of course, I cannot learn all these languages but at least I am at intermediate level in Chinese now. 

(2) Set a realistic goal. Normally I often make a weekly, monthly and yearly goal. A smaller step is always easier to achieve.  

(3) Mistakes are fine.
