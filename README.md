   ## What is a growth mindset?
   
A growth mindset is a belief that one can learn something new (skills, knowledge, etc) with persistent, right stratergies and practice. 

  ## Ways that I use to develop a growth mindset
  
* ***Learn something new***. It can be a new language, an instrument, hisotry or economics. I tried to learn couples different languages beside my native one, which is Vietnamese, and secondary one, which is English. The list is French, Spanish, Japanese, Korean and Chinese. Of course, I cannot learn all these languages but at least I am at intermediate level in Chinese now. 

* ***Set a realistic goal***. Normally I often make a weekly, monthly and yearly goal. A smaller step is always easier to achieve.  

* ***Mistakes are fine***. This is a part of the learning process. As long as, I learn something out of them.
